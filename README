# Run the code in Matlab

There are 9 Matlab files including 8 executable programs and 1 function:
Click the run button. You will probably be asked to input a number to choose the dataset:
#1 data.mat, #2 pose, #3 illumination
Just type the number: 1, 2 or 3

Task #1 Identifying the subject label from a test image:

Bayes_Classifier.m : Bayes’ Classifier with Maximum Likelihood estimation and Gaussian assumption

k_Nearest_Neighbor.m: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) rule to classify the test data

PCA_Bayes_Classifier.m: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Bayes’ Classifier

PCA_k_Nearest_Neighbor.m: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) rule

MDA_Bayes_Classifier.m: Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) with Bayes’ Classifier

MDA_k_Nearest_Neighbor.m: Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) rule



Task #2 Neutral vs. Facial expression classification

Kernel_SVM.m: Kernel SVM classifier by solving the dual optimization problem. You will be asked about the Kernel function that you want to use:
#1 Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, #2 polynomial kernel
Kernel.m: A function used in Kernel_SVM.m
Boosted_SVM.m: AdaBoost algorithm for the class of linear SVMs
